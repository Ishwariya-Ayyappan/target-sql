# Target Brazil Case Study – SQL-Based Business Analytics Project
 
  Performed an in-depth analysis of Target’s operations in Brazil by examining a dataset of 100,000 customer orders placed between 2016 and 2018.
  Leveraged SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data across multiple dimensions, including order status, pricing structures, payment and freight performance, customer geography, product categories, and review scores.
  Exploratory analysis focused on identifying key operational inefficiencies and business opportunities. 
  Evaluated patterns in order fulfillment delays, shipping ,payment methods, and regional demand variability. Assessed customer feedback and product ratings to determine satisfaction levels and isolate product-related concerns.
  Generated actionable insights that supported strategic recommendations such as improving logistics performance, optimizing pricing strategies by region and category, enhancing payment process efficiency, and tailoring product offerings based on customer demographics and preferences.
  This project demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in retail operations and highlighted opportunities for improving customer experience and profitability in Target’s international markets.
